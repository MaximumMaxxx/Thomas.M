### Why were they made?

Traditional refrigerants had some issues, they used toxic, flamable and/or refrigerants like Ammonia, Sulfor dioxide, Propane, or Methyl Chloride. Seeing this issue while working at General Motors Midgley decided to find a better chemical. After some research he came across $CCl_2F_2$, Carbon dichloride difluoride, or Freon-12 along with some similar variants like Freon-11. Freon and similar gasses are sometimes refered to as CFC's. Freon made an ideal refrigerant becuase of it's a compressable, non-toxic non-flamable gas with a low boiling point and low viscosity. 

### Usage

Freon had many uses, along with being a refrigerant it was used in.
- Aerosols as a propellant
- Solvents
- Air-conditioning systems
- Fire extinguishers
- Inhalant drug (Yes people are stupid)

### Downfall

The ozone layer wich protects us from dangerous and cancer causing ultraviolet light rays was put in danger by Freon and other similar chemicals. As it turns out whever a Freon molocule got hit by light it can cause $O_3$ to break down into $O_2$ or ozone to oxygen. This caused the hole in the ozone layer which we are [still dealing with today](https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/). 

In 1989 the Montreal Protocol went into affect limiting the production of Freon, CFC's and other chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. This put an end to Freon's production. We have found and largely replaced it with other safer gases like $CO_2$, Diflouromethane, Teraflouroethane, and Isobutane.

It was also later discovered that Freon is a very potent greenhouse gas which the leaking of is a noticable cause of global warming.
