# Why were CFC's made and what were their impact?

### Why were they made?

Traditional refrigerants had some issues, they used toxic or flamable refrigerants like Ammonia, Sulfor dioxide, Propane, or Methyl Chloride. Seeing this issue while working at General Motors he decided to find a better chemical. After some research he came across $CCl_2F_2$, Carbon dichloride difluoride, or Freon-12 along with some similar variants like Freon-11. Freon made an ideal refrigerant becuase of it's a compressable, non-toxic non-flamable gas with a low boiling point and low viscosity. 

### Usage

Freon had many uses, along with being a refrigerant it was used in.
- Aerosols as a propellant
- Solvents
- Air-conditioning systems
- Fire extinguishers
- Inhalant drug (Yes people are stupid)

### Downfall

The ozone layer wich protects us from dangerous and cancer causing ultraviolet light rays was put in danger by Freon and other similar chemicals. As it turns out whever a Freon molocule got hit by light they can cause $O_3$ to break down into $O_2$ or ozone to oxygen. This caused the hole in the ozone layer which we are still dealing [with today](https://ozonewatch.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
