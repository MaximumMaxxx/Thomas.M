## TEL

### What is knocking
- When the compression cycle goes up after most of the gas has burned a small amount can compress and ignite without a spark

### Why is it bad?
- Irratating noise
- overheating
- loss of power output
- wasted gas
- possibly damage to the engine

### What did he try?
- Wanted to try red dye but there wasn't any in the stock room
- Tried iodine
	- It worked but was expensive
- Later tried red dye but it had no effect
- Colorless ethyl iodide did work
- WW1 kinda interupted him but after the war he was back
- Given two weeks to find a new knock inhibitor
- Aniline did work but smelled bad
- Tetrylethllead worked super well
	- $\frac{1}{40}th \text{ of 1\% required to work fine}$

### The antiknock has been patented now


## Freon

### Why was it needed?
- Refrigerants were flamable and toxic making them danerous

### How was Freon discovered
- Using the periodic table Midgley and his colleagues fund a few different variants 

### What is it used for?
- Refrigerants
- Aresols
- Air conditioning

Midgley died from being tangled in a series of pullies he used to move around after being paralyzed by Polio
