Thomas Midgley Jr. was born in Beaver Fall, Pennsylvania on May 18th 1889. In 1911 he got a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell and later that year on Augest 3 1911 he married Carie Reynolds.

Midgley started working at General Motors (GM) in 1916 where he was tasked with finding a solution to engine knocking *see [[Lead in da gas]] for more info*. In December 1922 he got 1923 Nicholas Medal. In 1923 he got lead poisioning and took a vacation to recover. The banning of lead from gas lead to 2 million less death, greater overall intelligence and 58 million less crimes according to the UN.

Later during his time at GM Midgley was tasked with the creation of a new refrigerant. He settled on Freon *See [[CFC's and their impacts]]*. Freon caused a large hole in the ozone layer which is still healing today and is a potent greenhouse gas. 

As remarked by [New Scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Scientist) he is a "one-man environmental disaster".
