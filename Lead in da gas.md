### Why was Lead put in gas

To understand why we needed to put lead in gas you have to understand engine knocking. Here is a diagram of a normal combustion engine cycle.

The cylinder does down and lets air and fuel in in, goes up and compresses the air while also activating the spark plug, this then combusts pushing the cylinder downwards and the engine exhausts the exhaust. 

Engine knocking is when during the compression stage the fuel auto ignites under the preasure before the spark plug activates. This causes numerous problems like an irritating noise, overheating, loss of power, damage to the engine, and wasted gas.

This is the problem that Thomas Midgley was assigned to solve. 

#### How did he discover it?

Midgley's first attempt to solve the problem showed that iodine cold stop the knocking. There was the issue that a. Iodine added about \$1 to the gas price or \$25.60 in todays money. Iodine also had the drawback of damaging your carburator, gasoline piping, and engine. Although it was impractical Iodine did show that preventing knocking was possible and gave Thomas motivation.

His search was interupted by WW1 where Thomas instead worked on sythetic aviation fuels. After returning from war DELCO where he was working before was sold to GM who gave him 2 weeks to find a new knock agent. Aniline was found however it too had downsides.

Eventually a more scientific approach was taken which eventually lead to Tetraethylllead. TEL worked at a concentration as low as $\frac{1}{40}$th of 1%. With this new practical and effective anti knock solution the modern high power internal combustion engine could now become a reality.

On Feb. 23 1926 TEL was patented for use to prevent knocking

### The mass manufacture and marketing of TEL

GM motors made deals with standard oil since GM makes engines and standard makes gas. They jointly founded the Ethyl Corportation and hired Dupont to operate the manufacturing. Within the first year of plant operations there was already lead posioning, hallucinations, insanity and even deaths caused by lead poisioning. Despite this the Ethyl Corporation denied any significant public health dangers even though lead increased over 625 times previous levels in the past century. 

TEL eventually was banned by the Clean Air Act in 1971. We now use unleaded gas in our cars. 

### Long term effects

Lead is not a good chemical to be around and it's not a good chemical to have in your gas. Studies have shown that violent crime and lead have a strong corrolation. Lead also has other long term side effects like depression, memory issues, headaches, etc.

According to the UN the worldwide ban of leaded gas resulted in 2 million fewer early deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes.
